# ProbCog: A Toolbox for Statistical Relational Learning and Reasoning #

![ProbCog](http://www.power-xs.net/opcode/nop/software/external/probcog.jpg)

**ProbCog** is a statistical relational learning and reasoning system that supports efficient learning and inference in relational domains. We provide an extensive set of open-source tools for both undirected and directed statistical relational models.

The following representation formalisms for probabilistic knowledge are supported:

- Bayesian Logic Networks (BLNs)
- Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) & Adaptive Markov Logic Networks (AMLNs)
- Bayesian Networks (BNs)

Though ProbCog is a general-purpose software suite, it was designed with the particular needs of technical systems in mind. Our methods are geared towards practical applicability and can easily be integrated into other applications. The tools for relational data collection and transformation facilitate data-driven knowledge engineering, and the availability of graphical tools makes both learning or inference sessions a user-friendly experience. Scripting support enables automation, and for easy integration into other applications, we provide a client-server library.
